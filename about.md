Hi.

Here as a **company** you will find all instructions about the site, specially how to post a job opportunity.

If you are a candidate, please visit [the candidate page](/about-candidate.md).

Here you have the FAQ:

- # How to post a job
  - As soon as you [make the payment](https://buy.stripe.com/dR6g1B7d3fcIdjOfZ2) you will recieve a form that you fill with the job information.
  - Use the same email that you used in the payment link.
  - As soon as you submit the form, my **semi-automatic process** will generate the job post and I will validate.
